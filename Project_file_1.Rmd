```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Installing the package Tidyverse
We require the package Tidyverse for any sort of Data operations in R. Installing and loading the library using the following:

```{r Tidyverse,echo=TRUE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

# Reading the Data
Uploaded the Data file(CSV file) in R environment and then stored it into a dataframe called df by using the read_csv function

```{r read_csv, echo=TRUE}
df=read_csv("202204-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```

# Summary of the Data
Initially we observed all the details about the columns. The total number of rows also was obtained from the summary.

```{r summary,echo=TRUE}
summary(df)
```

# Segregate the member data
To seperate the annual members we create a new dataframe called df2 which will have only the member values from member_casual column and also we find the number of rows of df2

```{r members,echo=TRUE}
df2=df[df$member_casual=='member',]
nrow(df2)
```

# Calculating the time taken for Bike rides
We create using the mutate function a new dataframe df3 containing the time difference column in hours. The time difference is taken by the difftime function using start time and end time of the rides

```{r difftime,echo=TRUE}
df3=mutate(df,time_difference_hours = difftime(ended_at, started_at, units = "hours"))
```

# Analying the time differences obtained
We observed the time differences for all the rides and found the mean time taken for a ride and also the range i.e min and max values.

```{r time_difference,echo=TRUE}
df3$time_difference_hours
range(df3$time_difference_hours)
mean(df3$time_difference_hours)
```

# Installing Geosphere
To calculate the distance between the start station and end station we use the disthaversine function which is a part of geosphere library. So installing the geosphere library.

```{r geosphere,echo=TRUE}
install.packages("geosphere")
library(geosphere)
```

# Creating a dataframe for the distances
Using disthaversine function we calculate the distance and we store it in the new dataframe called df4

```{r distHaversine,echo=TRUE}
df4=mutate(df,distance_km = distHaversine(cbind(start_lng, start_lat), cbind(end_lng, end_lat))*0.001)
```

# Analyzing the ride distances
We observe the distance_km data as well as summarize it

```{r ride_distances,echo=TRUE}
df4$distance_km
summary(df4$distance_km)
```

# Segergetating the casual data
we separate the casual data in the member_casual column and create it in data frame called df6

```{r casual,echo=TRUE} 
df6=df[df$member_casual=='casual',]
```

# Analysing time difference
Using the mutate function we creat the time_difference_column for df6 by taking the difference between ended_at and started_at. We also view the time difference column in the new data frame created.

```{r time_diff_casual,echo=TRUE}
df7 <- mutate(df6, time_difference_hours = difftime(ended_at, started_at, units = "hours"))
df7$time_difference_hours
```

# Statistics of time differnce 
For the data frame df7 which contains casual members and time diffrences for each of those rides we observe the range and the mean

```{r range_mean,echo=TRUE}
range(df7$time_difference_hours)
mean(df7$time_difference_hours)
```

# Observing the threashold value
We now observe for how many rides in the casual data the time difference is greater than a threshold value. After a lot of trials we took a threshold value of 5 for understanding how much percentage of casual riders can be converted to annual members.

```{r threashold,echo=TRUE}
sum(df7$time_difference_hours>5)
```
